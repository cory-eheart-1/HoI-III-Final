        <h2>What is the relationship between the past and the present?</h2>
        <p>The question above is an incredibly difficult question to answer, but my professors challenged me to do so by utilizing that inquiry as the foundation of an entire semester of education.</p>
        <p>History of Ideas III - taught by Dr. Kris McAbee and Dr. Jana McAuliffe - tasked my classmates and me to answer the above question by analyzing and applying a set of theoretical and anecdotal works.</p>
        <p>However, I find the question to not be objectively answered in any capacity by any work or individual. I believe that both the reader and the author play a role in an individual's interpretation of the relationship between the past and the present and that no two people will have the same answer. Every interpretation of the answer is dependent on that individual's past and their interpretation of an author's answer.</p>
        <p>The purposes of this webpage are two-fold: to convey how I believe the author of each of my chosen readings answers the question, and to present my own answer to the question above based on a set of readings I encountered during the course. My chosen readings are "Soft-Soaping Empire" by Anne McClintock and <i>Kindred</i> by Octavia Butler.</p>
        <p>Within each page, there will be an explanation of the reading and its parts which pertain to answering the question (spoilers ahead) and a button to display my interpretation of how the author answers the question. The reasoning behind hiding my interpretations are to allow you - the reader - to determine your own interpretation of each reading and the overall question before seeing mine. I do not want my answers to persuade your own.</p>

        <p id="myanswer">I believe that the past and the present both rely on and directly influence one another, and that ultimately every individual interprets this relationship differently. In terms of the past acting on the present, this is fairly obvious. History is taught specifically to detail past actions and ideologies as to teach the public what choices should be made in the present. However, it is how the present influences the past that can be harder to understand. Everyday new information is discovered about the motivations and actions of the past. All of this information shapes how each individual interprets the past from their perspective. This is especially apparent with the understanding that not everyone has the same access to information as others. The means individual to individual their interpretation of why actions in the past occurred and how they define a person morally are vastly different. Even with the interpretations I featured on each of my chosen readings, a classmate of mine would read the same material and walk away with a vastly different idea of the relationship between the past and the present.</p>
