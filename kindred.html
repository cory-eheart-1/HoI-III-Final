    <h2><i>Kindred</i></h2>
    <h3>Octavia Butler</h3>
    <section id="kindred-summary">
        <p><i>Kindred</i> is the story of Dana, a twenty-six-year-old African American woman in 1976, who is suddenly forced into a series of time-travel rescue missions located in the Antebellum South to preserve her own birth. With the help of her husband Kevin and the pivotal people of her family's past, Dana is required not only to keep herself alive but to also protect her "several times great grandfather" (p. 28) Rufus from dying long enough for his child to be born. After several trips to the past and back to the present, Dana and Kevin deduce that Dana is summoned to the past when Rufus is in danger, and Dana is sent back to the present when she is in danger. However, the trips take a turn when Dana discovers she can take Kevin with her.</p>
        <p>Each time Dana is transported to the past to save Rufus, she learns more of his own personality as well as the important figures around him. Not only is she required to read up on the past during her time in the present to learn how to survive, but Dana is forced to keep her head down and play by every rule at all times - even those that oppose her beliefs. Dana has to keep her mouth shut when the white people around her demand she do anything, even tasks that she is not hired to do later on in the novel. Dana also must maintain these established rules when no one is around to enforce them, as anyone at any time could expose her for misbehaving. Her breaking of rules results in Dana receiving multiple lashings throughout the novel.</p>
        <p>The biggest internal conflict present in the novel is Dana's own need for Rufus and Alice's relationship (several times great-grandparents) to be consensual and loving. She needs Rufus to be a good person. However, this ultimately is not the case, as one of the times Dana is called to the past to save Rufus is after he is beaten nearly to death for raping Alice. This action does not stop Dana from helping Rufus. Dana goes as far as trying to convince Alice to get with Rufus and ignore the traumatic experience she encountered with him. Towards the end of the novel, it is revealed that in a ploy to get Alice to stay with Rufus, he sent their children to his relatives and convinced her that he had sold them into slavery. In utter devastation, Alice hung herself in the barn. By the end of this depressing stint in the past, Dana and Rufus were in the attic together. They discussed what had happened. After having a brief thought that it would not be so bad if Dana slept with Rufus, she stabbed him multiple times. Even after all that had happened, Dana thought she might have enjoyed sleeping with Rufus.</p>

        <p id="kindred-answer">Butler makes the argument that the relationship between the past and the present is infinitely intertwined. Not only does our knowledge of the past influence our present decisions, but our present understandings of the past lead us to ignore discovered information of the past. Dana spent most the novel learning as much about the past as she could to survive. On the other hand, she actively ignored apparent information about Rufus from the past to protect her own need for Rufus to be good. Dana overlooked racism, rape, assault, anger issues, and more in the hopes that Rufus and Alice would be in love mutually. I believe Butler was proposing that even those who understand the past and advocate for accurate portrayals of history will often over looking newly available information when their biases have been set for so long. No one wants their lineage to be full of horrible people, and Butler's choice to leave Dana yearning for a better heritage until the bitter end represents how all of us wish the past was better.</p>
