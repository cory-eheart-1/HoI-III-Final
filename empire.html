    <section id="empire-summary">
        <p>"Soft-Soaping Empire" is an article discussing how the commoditization of soap shaped the colonial motivations of Britain by labeling cleanliness as civility. "Soap is Civilization" was the slogan of the Unilever Company, and soap became synonymous with being clean but also with being of cleanliness.</p>
        <p>Before the heavy promotion of soap as a civil item, colonial and racist ideals were stapled in 'science'. Often Britain would justify their assimilation of smaller countries through a scientific basis. This included that white descendants were superior genetically, that dark skin was a negative mutation, etc. However, following the aggressive campaign of soap companies to sell cleanliness as civility, racial and colonial motivations became rooted in commodity. If one had access to be clean regularly, then one had civility; this perpetuated belief shaped the argument for Britain conquering and controlling "uncivilized" people.</p>
        <p>"Commodity racism", as McClintock coined it, was far more powerful in shaping the views of the public. Scientific racism was often restricted to the elites who could read in-depth research. However, commodity racism reached everyone. The lowest classes in Britain were able to understand that "Soap is Civilization". Even the most uneducated were able to connect unclean people with uncivil actions. This pushed colonial beliefs even further to the public, as they often agreed with the harsh means of conquering smaller nations due to their uncleanliness.</p>
        <section id="image">
            <p>For instance, Pears' Soap Company put out a plethora of racist ads. An example highlighted in McClintock's article is an image featuring two illustrations separated by the Pears' Soap logo (pictured right). The top image features an adolescent white boy handing a bar of soap to an adolescent black boy climbing into the bathtub. Across the bathtub is the text "Matchless for the Complexion". The bottom image is meant to be an after shot. The adolescent white boy is holding a mirror up to the adolescent black boy, and the black boy is now white from the neck down.</p>

        <p>McClintock goes on to discuss a series of early ads which sold commodities as civility. These ads racialized domesticity, and portrayed lacking these advertised commodities as uncivil and savage. Furthermore, commodity was used as a nationalist weapon. War heroes, war efforts, colonial campaigns, and more were advertised with these commodities. Items sold featured these scenes on boxes, labels, and sometimes the item itself had nationalist branding.</p>

        <p id="empire-answer">McClintock's article represents how present ideologies can shape the supporting argument for both past and present actions. Before the widespread advertisement of commodity as civility, the public view of colonized countries was essentially handed to them by aristocrats. The public followed the opinion of the rich. However, companies who began advertising commodities with racial tones led the public to believe that white was pure and civil. This present (from their perspective) advertisement of "cleanliness is civility" shaped both past and present interpretations of the colonialist beliefs of Britain. Suddenly, there was a widespread argument which supported conquering and capturing smaller countries: they were not clean, and they were not civil. This is further supported by the majority of these commodity ads being racially motivated. As specified earlier, the Pears' Soap baby ad blatantly represented white as clean and black as dirty. This idea went further when national heroes and scenes of triumphant war were pushed through the packaging of these commodities. Now war felt more personal and more necessary to support. Advertising commodities in the manner in which Britain did at this time gave reason for the public to support the colonial efforts of Britain from their own perspective, and this shaped colonial ideals for decades to follow.</p>
