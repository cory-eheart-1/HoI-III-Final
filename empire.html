    <section id="empire-summary">
        <p>"Soft-Soaping Empire" is an article discussing how the commoditization of soap shaped the colonial motivations of Britain through labeling cleanliness as civility. "Soap is Civilization" was the slogan of the Unilever Company, and soap became synonymous with being clean but also with being of cleanliness.</p>
        <p>Before the heavy promotion of soap as a civil item, colonial and racist ideals were stapled in 'science'. Often Britain would justify their assimilation of smaller countries through scientific bais. This included that white descendants were superior genetically, that dark skin was a negative mutation, etc. However, following the aggressive campaign of soap companies to sell cleanliness as civility, racial and colonial motiviations became rooted in commodity. If one had access to be clean regularly, then one had civility; this perpetuated belief shaped the argument for Britain conquering and controlling "uncivilized" people.</p>
        <p>"Commodity racism", as McClintock coined it, was far more powerful in shaping the views of the public. Scientific racism was often restricted to the elites who could read in depth research. However, commodity racism reached everyone. The lowest of classes in Britain were able to understand that "Soap is Civilization". Even the most uneducated were able to connect unclean people with uncivil actions. This pushed colonial beliefs even further to the public, as they often agreed with the harsh means of conquering smaller nations due to their uncleanliness.</p>
        <section id="image">
            <p>For instance, Pears' Soap Company put out a plethora of racist ads. An example highlighted in McClintock's article is an featuring two illustrations seperated by the Pears' Soap logo (pictured right). The top image features an adolescent white boy handing a bar of soap to an adolescent black boy climbing into the bathtub. Across the bathtub is the text "Matchless for the Complexion". The bottom image is meant to be an after shot. The adolescent white boy is holding a mirror up to the adolescent black boy, and the black boy is now white from the neck down.</p>
